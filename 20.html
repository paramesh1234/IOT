<h1 style="color:red;">Ratan Tata was born in Bombay,</h1> now Mumbai, on 28 December 1937,[9] and is the son of Naval Tata (born in Surat). <p style="color:darkblue;">His biological maternal grandmother had been the sister of Hirabai Tata,</p> wife of group founder Jamshedji Tata. His biological father, Hormusji Tata, had belonged to the broader Tata family; Naval therefore was a Tata by birth. Parents Naval and Sonoo separated <h1 style="font-family:verdana;">in 1948 when Ratan was 10</h1>, and he was subsequently raised by the widow of Sir Ratanji Tata, his grandmother, Navajbai Tata, who formally adopted him through the <h1 style="font-size:300%;">J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage.[10] He has a half-brother, Noel Tata (from Naval Tata's second marriage</h1> with Simone Tata), with whom he was raised. His first language is Gujarati.[11]

He studied at the Campion School <p style="font-size:160%;">till the 8th class, followed by Cathedral and John Connon School</p> and at Bishop Cotton School in Shimla,[12] and, in 1955, graduated from Riverdale Country School in New York City.[13][14] In 1959, he then received a B. Arch. <h1 style="text-align:center;">degree in Architecture with Structural Engineering from Cornell</h1> University, and in 1975, attended <p style="text-align:center;">the seven-week Advanced Management Program of Harvard Business School â€” an institution which</p> he has since endowed.[15][16]
