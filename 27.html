During the 21 years &nbsp; he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, <font size=10 color=red>&lt;</font> and profit, over 50 times.[18] Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from <font size=10 color=black>&gt;</font> commodities when he took over, the majority sales came from brands when he exited.<font size=10 color=green>&amp;</font>[22][23] He boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, <font size=10 color=skyblue>&quot;</font>Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to acquire Corus<font size=10 color=skyblue>&quot;</font>. All this turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% revenues coming from operations <font size=10 color=chocolate>&apos;</font>and sales in over 100 countries<font size=10 color=chocolate>&apos;</font>.[18][24] He conceptualised the Tata Nano car.[20] As he explained in a recent[when?] <font size=10 color=red>&cent;</font>interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging Markets project, the development of the Tata Nano was significant because it helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer.[25]
